// STEP 1: Create a function to contain the scene
 
 
    // STEP 2a: Create the scene itself
    
 
 
    // STEP 7a: Add an ArcRotateCamera (first comment out STEP 3a and 3b)
    
    // STEP 7b: Attach the camera to the canvas so that it can control the scene
    
 
 
    // STEP 3a: Create and position a camera
    
    // STEP 3b: Target the camera to the scene origin
    
 
 
    // STEP 4a: Install a light aiming up at the sky, and attach to the scene
    
    // STEP 4b: Dim the light just a bit
    
 
 
    // STEP 5a: Create a ground object, and attach to the scene
    
    // STEP 5b: Create a constant for the ground material, and attach to the scene
    
    // STEP 5c: Set the color of the ground material to green
    
    // STEP 5d: Create a new texture for the ground, and attach to the scene
    
    // STEP 5e: Set the texture property of the ground material to the above grass image
    
    // STEP 5f: Set the material property of the ground to the ground material created above
    
 
 
    // STEP 6a: Import a mesh model of an aeroplane, and include a callback function for when the model loads
 
 
        // STEP 6b: Scale the mesh model - it is pretty small
        
        // STEP 6c: Experiment with positioning the model
        
 
 
    // STEP 2b: Return the scene
